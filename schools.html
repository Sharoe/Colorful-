								<img src="img/sport.jpg">
								<p class="updates">A comfortable 3-0 win over St Ignatius College in the final saw Prince Edward reclaim the Hammer & Tongues Cup at St George’s College in the capital yesterday. The St George’s Hammer & Tongues invitational came to life in 2013. Prince Edward won that inaugural tournament and defended it well in 2014 before going on to miss out on the cup in 2015 and 2016. It was a perfect tournament for the Prince Edward boys as they won all their matches from the group stages through to the finals. In the group stages, Prince Edward dealt Tynwald a massive 6-0 defeat while working their way past a determined Marondera High side with a 2-1 win. Induna High School(1-0) and Falcon College(2-0) also fell to Prince Edward in the group stages.</p>
								<p class="updates">Sodbury, almost ruled out of the quarter finals due to a log table miscalculation gave Prince Edward a good run but went down 3-1 in the second quarter-final. One-nil outcomes were the order of the day in the semi-finals. St George’s and Goromonzi were both knocked out by 1-0 at the hands of St Ignatius and Prince Edward respectively. Up 1-0 going into the break in the final against St Ignatius, Prince Edward made light work of their hosts and sealed it off with two well worked goals in the second interval to round-up their 3-0 final win.While Prince Edward’s have now won the Hammer & Tongues tourney a record three times a more impressive statistic is that they only conceded two goals – against Marondera and Sodbury – en route to the final. Going against those two goals, they scored 18 goals in seven matches to reclaim the cup.  https://ssn.co.zw</p>

							<h3 class="head-3">DOES BRANDING MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THE SCHOOL PEOPLE CHOOSE</h3>
								<p class="para">My mother used to tell me ‘You only get one chance to make a first impression’; I still find this so very true. When looking for a school or college for your children you will want to find the very best you can for obvious reasons. A poor first impression is likely to put me off completely. A good first impression is far more likely to grab my attention and make me want to look at the school or college as a potential contender for my child’s educational needs. Believe me good branding makes all the difference for schools and colleges trying to fill their courses.Branding for schools and colleges is a must in this day and age. Schools and colleges have generally accepted that good branding is essential for their success.</p>

							<h3 class="head-3">CHOOSING A HIGH SCHOOL</h3>
							<img src="img/home.jpg" class="images">	
								<p>Back when we went to school chances are that your parents chose your high school either because it was nearby – or simply because it was the high school that your local school fed into. But now it seems that we’re overwhelmed with choices about our children’s secondary schooling.</p>
								<p>Local public high schools ~ The local public high school is undoubtedly the most inexpensive option, and it often offers an array of other benefits as well. Many high schools have an area of speciality and expertise – have a look at their websites to find out more.</p>
								<p>Selective schools ~ For children who are achieving academic excellence a selective school can be the preferred option. Children apply and sit a test and often have an interview after meeting a specific criteria.</p>
								<p>Performing arts/sporting ~ If your child has a talent at dancing, drama or music a performing arts high school could be on your radar. Children must submit an application form and audition to be accepted at these schools. Another option for athletically-gifted kids is a sporting high school. Schools such as these can be great for boosting children’s self-esteem as they can focus on an area in which they excel – while still getting a traditional education.</p>
								<p>Private schooling ~ For some private schooling is the expected norm, others will save to ensure their child has access to the highest level of amenities that money can buy. Private schooling is expensive, so it’s important that you have all the figures before making the commitment. The fees are often only the start – so make sure you’ve budgeted for tuition, uniforms and extracurricular activities.</p>
								<p>Religious high schools ~ If your child has attended a religious primary school then continuing on in this vein may be your choice. With an emphasis on Christian values, religious schools can offer moral guidance that appeals – and because they’re semi-private, religious schools can also tend to offer higher levels of infrastructure and teachers due to their fees. But that’s not always the case, so it’s best to check out any school first before making a decision.</p>
								<p>What’s right for your child? ~ Some children show talent, aptitude or interest from an early age – while others tend to cruise through life. Talk to your child about what they want from their schooling – and do plenty of research into what’s available in your area. You’ll want to find a balance between academia, interests, affordability and accessibility. Consider the other children attending the school and what types of friendship they may offer as well. Drive past the schools at lunchtime and before and after school. Do the teachers and students seem happy?</p>
								<p>Questions to ask ~ Start researching schools well before you need to. Attend any open days and feel free to ask the following questions of the school’s you’re interested in:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>What facilities are available?</li>
									<li>How is technology utilised?</li>
									<li>How many children attend this school and how many children are there in each class?</li>
									<li>Are there programs for special needs: eg slow learners or gifted students?</li>
									<li>What kind of extra-curricular activities are on offer?</li>
									<li>What are the school’s academic results?</li>
									<li>Are there specialist teachers available?</li>
									<li>Does the school seem well-maintained and inviting?</li>
								</ol>
								<p>Online research ~ The internet’s your best friend when it comes to finding a school. Good Luck!</p>
