				<h2>Academics at Parklands High School</h2>	
					<p>Academic achievement at Parklands High School has been excellent over the past years. We have a great team of highly trained and professional staff who are fully committed to provide the best educational experience possible. We are focused on regular and rigorous work and continue to find ways to encourage pupils to maintain a good work ethic and work with dedication and pride. We are committed to teach at a standard and level of difficulty that stretches our pupils academically beyond the scope of the formal syllabus and our pupils are encouraged to ensure they achieve results that reflect their abilities.
		At our annual Academic Awards Assemblies and Celebrations, achievers are recognized for their exceptional work. We also have our Academic Support Programme which is compulsory for persistent defaulters who do not reach their potential. We, the staff, pupils and Governors at PHS are committed to each pupil reaching their full potential.
		Over the past couple of years we have achieved a 100% pass rate.
